====================

benchmarking different approaches to computing statistics of large csv files

To run:
-----
* Put data in a directory $PWD/data where $PWD is where your data is. 
* $Rscript compute_stat.R 

which outputs freq_count.txt and results1.rda. All results are in the R object results1.rda
