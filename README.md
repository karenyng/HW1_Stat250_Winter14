====================

benchmarking different approaches to computing statistics of large csv files

To run:
-----
1) Put data in a directory $PWD/data where $PWD is where your data is. 
2) Rscript compute_stat.R 
which outputs freq_count.txt and results1.rda 
3) all results are in the R object results1.rda
